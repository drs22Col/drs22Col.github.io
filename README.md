## I'm a Masters student in Columbia University's QMSS program, where I am focusing on data analysis, data visualization, and the stories that data tells. My recent projects examine federal sentencing trends, recovery efforts after Hurricane Sandy, and the mutability of trust & the effects of personal disclosure.

## I worked for many years as a senior editor (and unofficial cartoonist) for Natural History magazine, editing articles on evolutionary biology and physics that ran the gamut from the altruism of social ameoba to the physics of multiple universes. I've contributed features and cover stories to Discover, AARP the Magazine, Forbes, and others. Previously I was an associate editor for Forbes and bond fund analyst for Morningstar. I hold a Masters degree in English literature, and also studied evolutionary biology and the philosophy of science. I love painting, guitar, ping pong and neutrinos.
