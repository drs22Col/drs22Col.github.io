## I'm a Masters student in Columbia University's QMSS program, studying data science. My recent projects examine federal sentencing trends, recovery efforts after Hurricane Sandy, and the mutability of trust & the effects of personal disclosure.

## I was a bond fund analyst for Morningstar, and more recently a senior editor for Natural History magazine, where I edited articles on evolutionary biology and physics. Previously I was an associate editor for Forbes where I analyzed funds and contributed science & technology stories. I have also written about neutrino physics and astrophysics for Discover, and about technology for AARP the Magazine, and others.
