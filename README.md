Hi! My name is Dolly, and I'm a Masters student in the Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences program, where I'm taking courses in data analysis and data visualization. I worked for many years as an editor for Natural History magazine and for Forbes, and my writing has appeared in Discover, Forbes, AARP the Magazine, and others. I've edited articles on everything from slime mold to multiple universes, reviewed nature and science-related books, and wrote an eight-page article for Discover on everybody's favorite particle, the neutrino. My cover stories for Forbes were featured on National Public Radio, where all my "ums" were edited out. Previously I was an analyst for Morningstar, and before that I earned a Masters degree in English literature. As a side project, I'm working on a dual scientific biography (where the beloved neutrino again does--and does not--rear its invisible head) that combines words with digital art, watercolor paintings and collage. My cartoons and illustrations have appeared in Natural History and Commonweal.
