## I'm a Masters student in Columbia University's QMSS program, studying data science. My recent projects examine federal sentencing trends, recovery efforts after Hurricane Sandy, portfolio strategies, and how to best filter inappropriate comments from a reddit board. 

## I started my career as an analyst for Morningstar and then wrote analytical articles about investments, science and technology for Forbes, where I also helped start a spin-off magazine. Following my passion for science, I became a senior editor for Natural History magazine, where I identified important research in evolutionary biology and physics, while taking evolutionary biology courses at Columbia. I also analyzed trends and advances in articles about neutrino physics and astrophysics for Discover. Then I decided I wanted to be a scientist myself, and found the perfect fit in data science, which led me to Columbia's Masters program.
