## I'm a Masters student in Columbia University's QMSS program, studying data science. My recent projects examine federal sentencing trends, recovery efforts after Hurricane Sandy, and the mutability of trust & the effects of personal disclosure.

## Before coming to Columbia, I was a senior editor for Natural History magazine, where I edited articles on evolutionary biology and physics. Before that I was an associate editor for Forbes, and a fund analyst for Morningstar. I have also written about neutrino physics and astrophysics for Discover.
