Hi! My name is Dolly, and I'm a Masters student in the Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences program at Columbia. I worked for many years as a senior editor for Natural History magazine where I developed and edited stories by scientists, and reviewed books. My focus was mainly evolutionary biology and physics: everything from the altruism of slime mold and the play of meerkats to the physics of multiple universes. In courses in the EEEB program at Columbia, I enjoyed studying the behavior and socioecology of the living primates, and conducting an observational study of captive capuchin monkeys. My writing has appeared in Forbes (where I was an editor before coming to NH), Discover, AARP The Magazine, and others. Previously I was a bond fund analyst for Morningstar, and before that I earned a Masters degree in English literature.
