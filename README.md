## I started my career as an analyst for Morningstar and then analyzed investments, science and technology for Forbes, where I also helped start a spin-off tech magazine. I've always loved math and science, and decided to become a senior editor for Natural History magazine where I edited biology and physics articles while taking evolutionary biology courses at Columbia. After taking a statistics class, I decided I wanted to do more problem-solving myself, so I earned a Masters degree from Columbia focusing on data science. My recent projects examine federal sentencing trends, recovery efforts after Hurricane Sandy, and how to best filter inappropriate comments from a reddit board.
