Hi! My name is Dolly, and I'm a Masters student in the Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences program. I worked for many years as a senior editor for Natural History magazine and earlier as an Associate Editor for Forbes. My writing has appeared in Discover, Forbes, AARP the Magazine, and others. I've edited articles on everything from slime mold to multiple universes, reviewed nature and science-related books, and wrote an eight-page article for Discover on everybody's favorite particle, the neutrino. My cover stories for Forbes were featured on National Public Radio, where all my "ums" were edited out. Previously I was an bond fund analyst for Morningstar, and before that I earned a Masters degree in English literature.
