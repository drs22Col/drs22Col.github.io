Hi! My name is Dolly, and I'm a Masters student in the Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences program at Columbia. I worked for many years as a senior editor for Natural History magazine where I developed and edited stories by scientists, conceptualized the visual components of articles, and reviewed books. My focus was mainly evolutionary biology and physics: everything from the altruism of slime mold and the play of meerkats to the physics of multiple universes. In courses in the EEEB program at Columbia, I enjoyed studying the behavior and socioecology of the living primates, and conducting an observational study of captive capuchin monkeys.

My writing has appeared in Forbes (where I was an editor before coming to NH), Discover, AARP The Magazine, and others. I particularly enjoyed writing an eight-page article for Discover about my favorite ghostly particle, the neutrino. It covered both applied and theoretical neutrino physics. Previously I was a bond fund analyst for Morningstar, and before that I earned a Masters degree in English literature. Among my favorite authors are Alice Munro (devastating), Richard Adams (endearing), George Orwell (terrifying), and the poet Elizabeh Bishop (I love her sestinas).

As a side project, I am working on a dual scientific biography set at the dawn of the nuclear age that combines words and images, and that explores the politics of memory. My cartoons and illustrations have appeared in Natural History and Commonweal.
