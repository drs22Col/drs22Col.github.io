Hi! My name is Dolly, and I'm a Masters student in the Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences program. I worked for many years as an editor for Natural History magazine and for Forbes, and my writing has appeared in Discover, Forbes and others. I've edited articles on everyting from slime mold to multiple universes, and wrote an eight-page article for Discover on everybody's favorite particle, the neutrino. My cover stories for Forbes were featured on National Public Radio, where all my "ums" were edited out. Previously I was an analyst for Morningstar. I've been researching a dual scientific biography (where the beloved neutrino again does--and does not--rear its invisible head) that I am illustrating with digital art, watercolor paintings and collage. I've always loved art. I started out by drawing cartoons, which appeared in Natural History and Commonweal, then graduated to trying to tell stories with pictures combined with words. I'm now interested in data visualization, as well as data analysis (I like math). On the side, I teach graduate-level writing at the New School University. I also hold an M.A. in English literature, meaning I like books as much as art and math. Last but not least, I'm  very fond of sloths and bonobos. Who isn't? Blue monkeys are pretty cool too.
