## I started my career as an analyst for Morningstar and then wrote analytical articles about investments, science and technology for Forbes, where I also helped start a spin-off magazine focused on the Internet and technology. Following my passion for science, I became a senior editor for Natural History magazine, where I identified important research in evolutionary biology and physics while taking evolutionary biology courses at Columbia. I also analyzed trends and advances in neutrino physics and astrophysics in articles for Discover. Then I decided I wanted to be a scientist myself, and found the perfect fit in data science.

## I recently completed a Masters degree in Columbia University's QMSS program, where I focused on data science and machine learning. My recent projects examine federal sentencing trends, recovery efforts after Hurricane Sandy, portfolio strategies, and how to best filter inappropriate comments from a reddit board. Currently I am a TRAC fellow, working on a project that grew out of my thesis with a Columbia law professor's guidance.
