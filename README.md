### I'm a Masters student in Columbia University's QMSS program , where I am focusing on data analysis, data visualization, and the stories that data tells. My projects focus on federal sentencing, recovery efforts after Hurricane Sandy, trust and the effects of personal disclosure.

### I worked for many years as a senior editor (and unofficial cartoonist) for Natural History magazine, where I edited articles on evolutionary biology and physics that ran the gamut from the altruism of slime mold to the physics of multiple universes. I've contributed articles to Discover, AARP the Magazine, Forbes, and others. Previously I was an associate editor for Forbes and bond fund analyst for Morningstar. I hold a Masters degree in English literature, and also studied evolutionary biology and the philosophy of science. I love art, guitar and ping pong.
