Hi! My name is Dolly, and I'm a Masters student in the Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences program. I worked for many years as an editor for Natural History magazine and for Forbes, and my writing has appeared in Discover, Forbes and other magazines. I've edited articles on everything from slime mold to multiple universes, and wrote an eight-page article for Discover on everybody's favorite particle, the neutrino. My cover stories for Forbes were featured on National Public Radio, where all my "ums" were edited out. Previously I was an analyst for Morningstar, and before that I earned an MA in English literature. 

I've always loved art and been interested in combining words with images in interesting ways. I started drawing pen-and-ink cartoons for Natural History and Commonweal, then graduated to full page cartoons. Eventually that led to researching a scientific biography (where the beloved neutrino again does--and does not--rear its invisible head) that combines words with digital art, watercolor paintings and collage. At Columbia, I'm taking courses in data visualization and data analysis.
