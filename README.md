## I'm a Masters student in Columbia University's QMSS program, studying data science. My recent projects examine federal sentencing trends, recovery efforts after Hurricane Sandy, portfolio strategies, and how to best filter inappropriate comments from a reddit board. 

## Before coming to Columbia, I was a senior editor for Natural History magazine, where I edited articles on physics and evolutionary biology. Before that I was an associate editor for Forbes, and a fund analyst for Morningstar. I have also written about neutrino physics and astrophysics for Discover.
