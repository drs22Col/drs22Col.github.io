## I started my career as an analyst for Morningstar and then wrote analytical articles about investments, science and technology for Forbes, where I also helped start a spin-off magazine. Following my passion for science, I became a senior editor for Natural History magazine, while taking evolutionary biology courses at Columbia. Then I decided I wanted to be a scientist myself, and recently completed a Masters degree focusing on data science at Columbia.  

## My recent projects examine federal sentencing trends, recovery efforts after Hurricane Sandy, portfolio strategies, and how to best filter inappropriate comments from a reddit board. Currently I am a TRAC fellow, working on a project that grew out of my thesis with a Columbia law professor's guidance.
